Silently is a package that allows you to run an IO action and prevent it from writing to stdout, or any other handle, by using "silence". Or you can capture the output for yourself using "capture".

For example, in GHCI

Prelude> :m + System.IO.Silently
Prelude System.IO.Silently> :m + System.IO
Prelude System.IO.Silently System.IO>
Prelude System.IO.Silently System.IO> print 1 >> silence (print 2 >> return "kittens!") >> print 3
1
3
Prelude System.IO.Silently System.IO> print 1 >> capture (hPutStrLn stdout "2" >> hPutStrLn stderr "3" >> return "puppies!")
1
3
("2\n","puppies!")
Prelude System.IO.Silently System.IO> print 1 >> hSilence [stderr] (hPutStrLn stdout "2" >> hPutStrLn stderr "3" >> return "kittens!") >> print 4
1
2
4
Prelude System.IO.Silently System.IO> print 1 >> hCapture [stdout,stderr] (hPutStrLn stdout "2" >> hPutStrLn stderr "3" >> return "puppies!")
1
("2\n3\n","puppies!")
