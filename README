Silently is a package that allows you to run an IO action and prevent it from writing to stdout, or any other handle.

For example, in GHCI

<pre>
Prelude> :m + System.IO.Silently
Prelude System.IO.Silently> let printFail s = undefined :: IO()
Prelude System.IO.Silently> let test1 = print 1 >> silently (print 2) >> print 3
Prelude System.IO.Silently> let test2 = print 1 >> silently (printFail 2) >> print 3
Prelude System.IO.Silently> test1
1
3
Prelude System.IO.Silently> test2
1
*** Exception: Prelude.undefined
Prelude System.IO.Silently> print "stdout still works after exceptions"
"stdout still works after exceptions"
</pre>
