Silently is a package that allows you to run an IO action and prevent it from writing to stdout, or any other handle, by using "silently". Or you can capture the output for yourself using "capture".

For example, in GHCI

Prelude> :m + System.IO.Silently
Prelude System.IO.Silently> let test1 = print 1 >> silently (print 2) >> print 3
Prelude System.IO.Silently> let test2 = print 1 >> silently (print undefined) >> print 3
Prelude System.IO.Silently> let test3 = capture (test1 >> return "puppies!")
Prelude System.IO.Silently> test1
1
3
Prelude System.IO.Silently> test2
1
*** Exception: Prelude.undefined
Prelude System.IO.Silently> test3
("1\n3\n","puppies!")
